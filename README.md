# LecternCrashFix
This fixes the new [lectern crash/exploit](https://github.com/Coderx-Gamer/lectern-crash). This bug is fixed on Paper build 276 and above. This is also fixed on [CraftBukkit](https://hub.spigotmc.org/stash/projects/SPIGOT/repos/craftbukkit/commits/2542945ef49093f6e1041dd817d6f640b7fc25b5). Make sure you update your Paper or Spigot servers!

This plugin is for servers who do not want to update. This plugin works on 1.16 and above.

This bug occurs by sending a "quick move" click onto a lectern slot. This fix simply checks if a player sends a "quick move" click in a lectern inventory and cancels it.

Requires [ProtocolLib](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/protocollib.1997/).
